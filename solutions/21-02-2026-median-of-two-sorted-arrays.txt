Problem: Median of Two Sorted Arrays

Approach:
We are given two sorted arrays and need to find the median of the combined sorted array, but without actually merging them. Since merging would take linear time, the goal is to solve it in O(log(min(n1, n2))) time.

The key idea is to use Binary Search on the smaller array. We always apply binary search on the smaller array to keep the complexity optimal. That’s why, if the second array is smaller, we swap them.

We imagine dividing both arrays into two halves such that the left half contains exactly half of the total elements. If the total number of elements is odd, the left half will contain one extra element.

We choose a partition in the first array and automatically determine how many elements must come from the second array so that the total left side size remains correct.

For a valid partition, two conditions must be satisfied:
The largest element on the left of the first array must be less than or equal to the smallest element on the right of the second array.
The largest element on the left of the second array must be less than or equal to the smallest element on the right of the first array.

If these conditions are satisfied, we have found the correct partition.

If the total number of elements is even, the median is the average of the maximum of the left elements and the minimum of the right elements. If the total number is odd, the median is simply the maximum of the left elements.

If the partition is not valid, we adjust our binary search accordingly. If left1 is too large, we move left in the first array. Otherwise, we move right.

Time Complexity: O(log(min(n1, n2)))
Space Complexity: O(1)

```cpp

class Solution {
public:
    double findMedianSortedArrays(vector<int>& nums1, vector<int>& nums2) {

        if (nums2.size() < nums1.size()) return findMedianSortedArrays(nums2, nums1);

        int n1 = nums1.size();
        int n2 = nums2.size();
        int low = 0, high = n1;

        while (low <= high)
        {
            int fromFirst = (low + high) / 2;
            int fromSecond = (n1+n2 + 1) /2 - fromFirst;

            int left1 = fromFirst == 0 ? INT_MIN : nums1[fromFirst-1];
            int left2 = fromSecond == 0 ? INT_MIN : nums2[fromSecond-1];

            int right1 = fromFirst == n1 ? INT_MAX : nums1[fromFirst];
            int right2 = fromSecond == n2 ? INT_MAX : nums2[fromSecond];

            if (left1 <= right2 && left2 <= right1)
            {
                if ((n1+n2) % 2 == 0)
                    return (max(left1, left2) + min(right1, right2)) / 2.0;
                    else
                        return max(left1, left2);
            }

            else if (left1 > right2)
            {
                high = fromFirst -1;
            }
            else
            {
                low = fromFirst + 1;
            }
        }
        
        return 0.0;
    }
