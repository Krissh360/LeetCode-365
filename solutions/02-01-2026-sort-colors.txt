Problem: Sort colors -> Sort the elements of a given array colored red, blue and white, which are basically represented by 0, 1 and 2 respectively.

NOTE: Must solve the problem without using the library's sorting functions.

Approach: My initial thought was to use a sorting algorithm to sort the array, but no sorting algorithm that I have studied till now would give me a better time complexity than O(nlogn). So I thought if I could possibly get a better solution for this. 
Since, the colors or the numbers in the array were given in the question, I thought I could count the frequencies of each of the numbers and then overwrite the given array using those frequencies.
Taking a variable "zero" as the number of zeroes in the original array. Same for 1's and 2's.
Then overwrite the first 'zero' elements with the number 0. Overwrite the next 'one' elements with the number 1 and the next 'two' elements with the number 2. This approach finally gave me a better result than simply using a sorting algorithm.

Time complexity: O(n)
Space complexity: O(1)

```cpp

class Solution {
public:
    void sortColors(vector<int>& nums) {

        int zero = 0, one = 0, two = 0;
        int n = nums.size();

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        {
            if (nums[i] == 0) zero++;
            if (nums[i] == 1) one++;
            if (nums[i] == 2) two++;
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < zero; i++) nums[i] = 0;
        for (int i = zero; i < (zero + one); i++) nums[i] = 1;
        for (int i = (zero + one); i < (zero + one + two); i++) nums[i] = 2;
        
    }
};
