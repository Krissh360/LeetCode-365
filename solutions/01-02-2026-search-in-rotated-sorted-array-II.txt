Problem: Search in Rotated Sorted Array II

Approach:
This problem is solved using a modified binary search that works even when the array contains duplicates.

At each step, I first check if the middle element is the target.
If the elements at `low`, `mid`, and `high` are the same, I shrink the search space from both ends to avoid ambiguity caused by duplicates.

Then, I check whether the left half is sorted.
If it is sorted, I check if the target lies within that range and move accordingly.
If the left half is not sorted, then the right half must be sorted, so I check there.

This way, I keep narrowing the search space until the target is found or the range becomes empty.

Time Complexity: O(log n) in average case, O(n) in worst case (due to duplicates).
Space Complexity: O(1)


```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool search(vector<int>& nums, int target) {

        int n = nums.size();
        int low = 0, high = n-1;

        while (low <= high)
        {
            int mid = (low + high) / 2;
            if (nums[mid] == target) return true;

            if (nums[low] == nums[mid] && nums[mid] == nums[high])
            {
                low++;
                high--;
                continue;
            }   

            // checking if left half is sorted
            if (nums[low] <= nums[mid])
            {
                if (nums[low] <= target && target <= nums[mid])
                {
                    high = mid - 1;
                }
                else
                {
                    low = mid + 1;
                }
            }
            // if not left, right half is definitely sorted
            else
            {
                if (nums[mid] <= target && target <= nums[high])
                {
                    low = mid + 1;
                }
                else
                {
                    high = mid - 1;
                }
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
};
