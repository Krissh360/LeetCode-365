Problem: Check if Array is Sorted and Rotated

Approach:
The idea is to count how many times the order of elements "drops", meaning a number is greater than the next one.
In a perfectly sorted array, this never happens.
In a sorted and rotated array, this can happen at most once — at the rotation point.

To handle the circular nature of rotation, I compared each element with the next one using modulo indexing.
If the number of such drops is more than one, the array is neither sorted nor properly rotated.

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)


```cpp


class Solution {
public:
    bool check(vector<int>& nums){

        int drops = 0;
        int n = nums.size();

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        {
            if (nums[i] > nums[(i + 1) % n])
            {
                drops++;
            }
        }

        return drops <= 1;
    }
};
