Problem: Subarray Sum Equals K

Approach:
The task is to count the number of continuous subarrays whose sum equals k.
We use the concept of Prefix Sum along with a hashmap to do this in linear time.
As we traverse the array, we keep track of a running prefix sum (preSum).
If at any index the current prefix sum is preSum,
we want to know how many previous prefix sums existed such that:
previous_preSum = preSum - k
Because if:
preSum - previous_preSum = k
then the subarray between those indices has sum k.
We store the frequency of each prefix sum in a hashmap.
Important detail:
We initialize the map with mpp[0] = 1 to handle cases where
a subarray starting from index 0 itself has sum k.

At every step:
- Update preSum
- Check how many times (preSum - k) has occurred before
- Add that to the count
- Store/update the current preSum in the map

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(n)

```cpp

class Solution {
public:
    int subarraySum(vector<int>& nums, int k) {

        unordered_map <int, int> mpp;
        mpp[0] = 1;
        int n = nums.size(), count = 0, preSum = 0;

        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        {
            preSum += nums[i];
            int remove = preSum - k;
            count += mpp[remove];
            mpp[preSum]++;
        }

        return count;
        
    }
};
