Problem: Longest Repeating Character Replacement

Approach: I used a sliding window approach with two pointers.
As the window expands, I maintain a frequency array to count characters and track the maximum frequency of any character inside the current window.
The idea is that the number of characters that need to be replaced is `(window size - max frequency)`.
If this value becomes greater than `k`, the window is no longer valid, so I shrink it from the left.
At each step, I update the maximum valid window size found.
This works because we only care about the most frequent character in the window, and the window remains optimal even if `maxfreq` is not recalculated during shrink operations.

Time Complexity: O(n)

Space Complexity: O(1)

```cpp

class Solution {
public:
    int characterReplacement(string s, int k) {

        int i = 0, j = 0, maxfreq = 0, answer = 0;
        vector <int> freq(26, 0);

        while (j < s.size())
        {
            freq[s[j] - 'A']++;
            maxfreq = max(maxfreq, freq[s[j] - 'A']);

            while((j-i+1) - maxfreq > k)
            {
                freq[s[i] - 'A']--;
                i++;
            }
            answer = max(answer, j-i+1);
            j++;
        }

        return answer;
    }
};
