Problem: Longest Balanced Substring I

Approach:
The goal is to find the longest substring where all characters that appear
have the same frequency.

To solve this, we use a brute-force approach:
We fix a starting index i, and then expand the substring
by increasing the ending index j.

For every new substring from i to j:
- We maintain a frequency array of size 26 (for lowercase letters).
- Each time we extend j, we update the frequency.

After updating the frequency, we check whether the substring is balanced.

The helper function balanced():
- Iterates through the frequency array.
- Ignores characters that do not appear.
- Stores the first non-zero frequency as a reference.
- If any other non-zero frequency differs, the substring is not balanced.

If the substring is balanced, we update the maximum length.

Time Complexity: O(n^2)
Space Complexity: O(1)

```cpp

class Solution {
public:

    bool balanced(vector<int>& freq)
    {
        int common = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++)
        {
            if (freq[i] == 0) continue;

            if (common == 0) common = freq[i];
            else if (freq[i] != common) return false;
        }

        return true;
    }

    int longestBalanced(string s) {

        int n = s.size();
        int mxfreq = INT_MIN;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        {
            vector<int> freq(26);

            for (int j = i; j < n; j++)
            {
                freq[s[j] - 'a']++;

                if (balanced(freq))
                    mxfreq = max(mxfreq, j - i + 1);
            }
        }

        return mxfreq;
    }
};
