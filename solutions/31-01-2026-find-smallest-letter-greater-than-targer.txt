Problem: Find Smallest Letter Greater Than Target

Approach:
Used binary search on the sorted character array.

The goal is to find the smallest letter strictly greater than the target.
If the current middle letter is less than or equal to the target, I move to the right half.
If it is greater, I store it as a potential answer and continue searching on the left side to find a smaller valid candidate.

If no such letter is found during the search, the answer wraps around to the first letter in the array (because the letters are considered circular).

Time Complexity: O(log n)
Space Complexity: O(1)

```cpp

class Solution {
public:
    char nextGreatestLetter(vector<char>& letters, char target) {

        int n = letters.size();
        int low = 0, high = n-1;
        char ans = '#';

        while (low <= high)
        {
            int mid = (low + high) / 2;

            if (letters[mid] <= target) low = mid + 1;

            else
            {
                ans = letters[mid];
                high = mid - 1;
            }
        }

        return (ans == '#') ? letters[0] : ans;

    }
};
