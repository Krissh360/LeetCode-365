Problem: Prefix Connected Words

Approach:
We are given a list of words and an integer k.

Two words are considered prefix-connected if they share the same first k characters.

To solve this:
1) Traverse all words.
2) If a word has length less than k, skip it.
3) Extract the first k characters using substr(0, k).
4) Store the prefix in a hashmap and count its frequency.

After processing all words, we iterate over the hashmap.

If any prefix appears more than once, it means multiple words share that prefix. We count such prefixes.

Finally, return the number of prefixes that occur more than once.

Time Complexity: O(n * k)
Space Complexity: O(n)

```cpp

class Solution {
public:
    int prefixConnected(vector<string>& words, int k) {

        int n = words.size(), ans = 0;
        unordered_map<string, int> occur;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        {
            if (words[i].size() < k) continue;

            string temp = words[i].substr(0, k);
            occur[temp]++;
        }

        for (const auto& pair : occur)
        {
            if (pair.second > 1) ans++;
        }

        return ans;
    }
};
