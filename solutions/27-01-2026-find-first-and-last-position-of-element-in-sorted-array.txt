Problem: Find First and Last Position of Element in Sorted Array

Approach:
Used binary search twice — once to find the first occurrence and once to find the last occurrence of the target.

For the first occurrence, whenever the target is found, I continue searching on the left side to check if an earlier index exists.
For the last occurrence, when the target is found, I continue searching on the right side to check for a later index.

If the first occurrence is not found, I directly return {-1, -1}.
Otherwise, I return the indices of both first and last occurrences.

This works because binary search allows narrowing the search space efficiently while still checking for boundary positions.

Time Complexity: O(log n)
Space Complexity: O(1)

```cpp

class Solution {
public:

    int firstOcc(vector <int> &nums, int target)
    {
        int low = 0, high = nums.size()-1, first = -1;

        while (low <= high)
        {
            int mid = (low + high) / 2;

            if (nums[mid] == target)
            {
                first = mid;
                high = mid - 1;
            }

            else if (nums[mid] < target) low = mid + 1;
            else high = mid -1; 
        }
        return first;
    }

    int lastOcc(vector <int> &nums, int target)
    {
        int low = 0, high = nums.size()-1, last = -1;

        while (low <= high)
        {
            int mid = (low + high) / 2;

            if (nums[mid] == target)
            {
                last = mid;
                low = mid + 1;
            }

            else if (nums[mid] < target) low = mid + 1;
            else high = mid - 1;
        }
        return last;
    }

    vector<int> searchRange(vector<int>& nums, int target) {

        int first = firstOcc(nums, target);
        if (first == -1) return {-1, -1};

        int last = lastOcc(nums, target);

        return {first, last};
    }
};
