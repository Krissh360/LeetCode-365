Problem: Majority Element

Approach: I used a map to store the frequency of each number while iterating through the array.
Every time a number appears, I increase its count.
If at any point a number’s frequency becomes greater than n/2, I mark it as the majority element.
This works because the problem guarantees that a majority element always exists.

Time Complexity: O(n log n)
Space Complexity: O(n)

```cpp

class Solution {
public:
    int majorityElement(vector<int>& nums) {

        int MajEl = 0, n = nums.size();
        map <int ,int> freq;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        {
            freq[nums[i]]++;

            if (freq[nums[i]] > floor(n/2)) MajEl = nums[i];
        }

        return MajEl;
    }
};
