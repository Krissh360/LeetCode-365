Problem: Minimum Pair Removal to Make Array Non-Decreasing

Approach:
The idea is to repeatedly modify the array until it becomes non-decreasing.

First, I check whether the current array is already sorted in non-decreasing order.  
If not, I scan all adjacent pairs and find the pair with the minimum sum.  
I then merge that pair by replacing the first element with their sum and removing the second element from the array.  
This process is repeated, and I count how many such merge operations are needed until the array becomes sorted.

Time Complexity: O(n²)
Space Complexity: O(1)

```cpp

class Solution {
public:
    int minimumPairRemoval(vector<int>& nums)
    {
        int operations = 0;

        while (true)
        {
            bool sorted = true;

            for (int i = 1; i < nums.size(); i++)
            {
                if (nums[i] < nums[i - 1])
                {
                    sorted = false;
                    break;
                }
            }

            if (sorted) break;

            int minSum = INT_MAX;
            int index = -1;

            for (int i = 0; i < nums.size() - 1; i++)
            {
                int sum = nums[i] + nums[i + 1];
                if (sum < minSum)
                {
                    minSum = sum;
                    index = i;
                }
            }

            nums[index] = minSum;
            nums.erase(nums.begin() + index + 1);

            operations++;
        }

        return operations;
    }
};
