Problem: Trionic array I

Approach:
A trionic array has three phases:
first strictly increasing, then strictly decreasing, and finally strictly increasing again.

I traversed the array in three steps:
1. Move forward while the elements are increasing.
2. From that point, move forward while the elements are decreasing.
3. From there, move forward again while the elements are increasing.

At each transition, ensured that each phase had at least one valid movement.
If the traversal reaches the end of the array exactly after these three phases, the array is trionic.

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)


```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isTrionic(vector<int>& nums) {

        int n = nums.size(), i = 0;
        
        while (i + 1 < n && nums[i] < nums[i + 1]) i++;
        if (i == 0 || i == n - 1) return false;

        int j = i;

        while (i + 1 < n && nums[i] > nums[i + 1]) i++;
        if (i == j || i == n - 1) return false;

        while (i + 1 < n && nums[i] < nums[i + 1]) i++;
        return i == n - 1;
    }
};
