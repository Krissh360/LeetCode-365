Problem: Divide an Array Into Subarrays With Minimum Cost I

Approach:
The goal is to pick three elements such that the total cost is minimized, with the condition that the first element must always be included.

I started by initializing the sum with the first element of the array.
Then, I scanned the remaining elements to find the smallest and second smallest values.
These two values, along with the first element, give the minimum possible total cost.

This works because to minimize the sum of three numbers where one is fixed, we simply need the two smallest numbers from the rest of the array.

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)


```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minimumCost(vector<int>& nums) {

        int n = nums.size();
        int sum = nums[0], mn = INT_MAX, smin = INT_MAX;

        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++)
        {
            if (nums[i] < mn)
            {
                smin = mn;
                mn = nums[i];
            }
            else if (nums[i] < smin)
            {
                smin = nums[i];
            }
        }

        sum += mn + smin;
        return sum;
    }
};
