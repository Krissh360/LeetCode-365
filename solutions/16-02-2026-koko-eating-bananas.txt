Problem: Koko Eating Bananas

Approach:
We need to find the minimum eating speed (k) such that all banana piles can be finished within h hours.

Observation:
If Koko eats faster, total hours needed decrease.
If she eats slower, total hours increase.

This monotonic behavior allows us to use Binary Search on the answer (the eating speed).

Step 1: Define Search Space
Minimum possible speed = 1
Maximum possible speed = maximum pile size

Step 2: Check Function For a given speed (mid), we calculate total hours needed:

For each pile:
hours = ceil(pile / mid)

Instead of using ceil directly, we use: (pile + mid - 1) / mid

We sum up hours for all piles. If total hours <= h, the speed is valid.

Step 3: Binary Search
- If mid is valid, store it as answer
  and try smaller speeds (search left).
- Otherwise, increase speed (search right).

We continue until low > high.

Time Complexity: O(n log maxPile)
Space Complexity: O(1)

```cpp

class Solution {
public:

    bool check(vector<int> &piles, int mid, int h)
    {
        long long sum = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < piles.size(); i++)
        {
            sum += (piles[i] + mid - 1) / mid;
        }

        return sum <= h;
    }

    int minEatingSpeed(vector<int>& piles, int h) {

        int n = piles.size();
        int mx = piles[0];

        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++)
        {
            if (piles[i] > mx)  mx = piles[i];
        }

        int low = 1, high = mx;
        int ans = mx;

        while (low <= high)
        {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;

            if (check(piles, mid, h))
            {
                ans = mid;
                high = mid - 1;
            }
            else
            {
                low = mid + 1;
            }
        }

        return ans;
    }
