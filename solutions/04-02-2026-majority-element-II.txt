Problem: Majority Element II

Approach:
The task is to find all elements that appear more than ⌊n/3⌋ times in the array.

I used a hashmap to keep track of the frequency of each element while traversing the array.
As soon as any element’s frequency exceeded n/3, I added it to the result vector.
To avoid adding the same element multiple times, I used a set to keep track of elements already included in the answer.

Since an element must cross the frequency threshold only once, this approach ensures correctness while remaining easy to reason about.

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(n)


```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> majorityElement(vector<int>& nums) {

        int n = nums.size();
        vector<int> ans;
        unordered_map<int, int> freq;
        unordered_set<int> added;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        {
            freq[nums[i]]++;

            if (freq[nums[i]] > floor(n/3) && added.count(nums[i]) == 0)
            {
                ans.push_back(nums[i]);
                added.insert(nums[i]);
            }
        }

        return ans;
    }
};
