Problem: Set matrix zeroes

Approach:

We will use two sets to store the indices of the elements that are zero. The i'th index of every such element will be stored in a set 'rows' and the j'th index will be stored in a set 'col'. 
Using unordered set will be a better choice as looking for the existence of an element in it only takes O(1) time.

We will start by traversing through the 2-D array and for every zero we encounter, we will insert it's indices in the two corresponding sets. This will cover all the possible elements' indices that we need to change to zero.

Once we have all the indices stored, we will traverse trough the array once again and this time, we will check if the i'th and the j'th indices of every encountered element exist in the corresponding sets. If they do, we will change that element in the array to zero.

Time complexity: O(m x n)
Space complexity: O(m x n)

```cpp

class Solution {
public:
    void setZeroes(vector<vector<int>>& nums) {
        
        int n = nums.size();
        int m = nums[0].size();
        unordered_set <int> rows;
        unordered_set <int> col;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        {
            for (int j = 0; j < m; j++)
            {
                if (nums[i][j] == 0)
                {
                    rows.insert(i);
                    col.insert(j);
                }
            }
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        {
            for (int j = 0; j < m; j++)
            {
                if (rows.contains(i) || col.contains(j))
                {
                    nums[i][j] = 0;
                }
            }
        }
        
    }
};
