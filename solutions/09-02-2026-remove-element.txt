Problem: Remove Element

Approach:
The task is to remove all occurrences of a given value from the array in-place
and return the number of elements that are not equal to that value.

Since the order of elements does not matter, we do not need any extra space.
We can solve this using the two-pointer technique.

We maintain a pointer k which represents the position where the next
valid (non-val) element should be placed.

We traverse the array once:
- If nums[i] is not equal to val, we place it at index k and increment k.
- If nums[i] equals val, we simply skip it.

By the end of the traversal, the first k elements of the array
will contain all the elements that are not equal to val.

The remaining part of the array does not matter.

Finally, we return k as the count of valid elements.

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)


```cpp

class Solution {
public:
    int removeElement(vector<int>& nums, int val) {
        int i = 0, j = 0;

       for(int i = 0; i<nums.size();i++)
       {
        if(nums[i] != val)
        {
             nums[j] = nums[i];
             j++;
        }
       }
       
       return j;
    }
};
