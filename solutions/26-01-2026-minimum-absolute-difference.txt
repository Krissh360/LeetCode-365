Problem: Minimum Absolute Difference

Approach:
First, I sorted the array so that the closest numbers would be adjacent.
Then, I traversed the sorted array and calculated the difference between every pair of adjacent elements while keeping a track of the minimum difference found so far.

If a new smaller difference was found, I cleared the result list and stored the new pair.
If the difference matched the current minimum, I added that pair to the result.

Sorted the array first because the minimum absolute difference between any two numbers in an array will always occur between two neighboring elements in the sorted order.

Time Complexity: O(n log n)
Space Complexity: O(1)

```cpp

class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> minimumAbsDifference(vector<int>& arr) {

        vector<vector<int>> res;
        int n = arr.size(), diff = INT_MAX;
        sort(arr.begin(), arr.end());

        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++)
        {
            if ((arr[i] - arr[i-1]) < diff)
            {
                diff = arr[i] - arr[i-1];
                res.clear();
                res.push_back({arr[i-1], arr[i]});
            }

            else if ((arr[i] - arr[i-1]) == diff)
            {
                res.push_back({arr[i-1], arr[i]});
            }
        }
        return res;
        
    }
};
