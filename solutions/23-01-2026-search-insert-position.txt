Problem: Search Insert Position

Approach:
Used a modified binary search on the sorted array.

The idea is to find the position where the target should be inserted if it is not already present.
I maintained two pointers, `low` and `high`, and repeatedly narrowed the search space.
If the middle element is smaller than the target, I move `low` to the right.
Otherwise, I move `high` to the left.

When the loop ends, `low` naturally points to the correct index where the target should be inserted.
This works because binary search keeps track of the first position where the element could fit.

Time Complexity: O(log n) 
Space Complexity: O(1) 

```cpp

class Solution {
public:
    int searchInsert(vector<int>& nums, int target) {

        int low = 0, high = nums.size() - 1;

        while (low <= high)
        {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;

            if (nums[mid] < target) low = mid + 1;

            else high = mid - 1; 
        }

        return low;
    }
};
