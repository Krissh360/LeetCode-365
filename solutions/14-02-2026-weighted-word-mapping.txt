Problem: Weighted word mapping

Approach:
We are given:
- A list of words
- A weight array for each lowercase letter (a to z)

For every word, we calculate its total weight by:
- Iterating through each character
- Adding the corresponding weight using:
  weights[word[j] - 'a']

Once we get the total weight of a word, we take sum % 26 to keep it within alphabet range.

Then we map it to a character using: 'z' - remainder

This effectively shifts backward from 'z' based on the remainder value.

We repeat this for all words and append each computed character to the result string.


Time Complexity: O(total characters in all words)
Space Complexity: O(1)

```cpp

class Solution {
public:
    string mapWordWeights(vector<string>& words, vector<int>& weights) {

        int n = words.size();
        string result = "";

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        {
            int j = 0, sum = 0;

            while (j < words[i].size())
            {
                sum += weights[words[i][j] - 'a'];
                j++;
            }

            int rem = sum % 26;
            result += char('z' - rem);
        }

        return result;
    }
};
