Problem: Add Binary

Approach:
We are given two binary strings and need to return their sum as a binary string.

Since binary addition works like normal addition (with carry), we simulate the process manually.

We start from the last characters of both strings because binary addition is done from right to left.

We maintain:
- Two pointers (i and j) for each string
- A carry value

At each step:
1) Add the carry.
2) If i is valid, add a[i].
3) If j is valid, add b[j].
4) Append (sum % 2) to the answer.
5) Update carry = sum / 2.

We continue until both strings are exhausted and no carry remains.

Since we build the answer in reverse order, we reverse it at the end.

Time Complexity: O(max(n, m))
Space Complexity: O(max(n, m))


```cpp

class Solution {
public:
    string addBinary(string a, string b) {

        string ans = "";
        int i = a.size() - 1, j = b.size() - 1;
        int carry = 0;

        while (i >= 0 || j >= 0 || carry)
        {
            int sum = carry;

            if (i >= 0)
            {
                sum += a[i] - '0';
                i--;
            }

            if (j >= 0)
            {
                sum += b[j] - '0';
                j--;
            }

            ans += (sum % 2) + '0';
            carry = sum / 2;
        }

        reverse(ans.begin(), ans.end());
        return ans;
    }
};
