Problem: Sum of beauty of all substrings

Approach: For calculating the difference of the highest and the lowest occurring character in all the substrings of a string, we certainly need to write an algorithm that gives all the substrings of a given string. So the algorithm used basically goes through all the substrings using a nested double loop. While going through each substring (meaning inside the inner loop), it stores the frequency of each character in that substring in a vector of size 26 (26 characters, only lower case English alphabets) and every element initialized as 0 in the start. While increasing the frequency of any character in this vector upon encountering the character, we check if the freq of that particular character is now greater than "highest", if so, replace it else let it be. Then we run a simple loop on this vector to find the lowest frequency. Then we calculate the difference of the highest and lowest frequency and add it to a global "sum".

Time complexity: O(n^2)
Space complexity: O(1)

```cpp

class Solution {
public:
    int beautySum(string s) {

        int n = s.size(), sum = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        {
            vector<int> freq(26, 0);
            int highest = 0;

            for (int j = i; j < n; j++)
            {
                freq[s[j] - 'a']++;

                if (freq[s[j] - 'a'] > highest) highest = freq[s[j] - 'a'];

                int lowest = INT_MAX;
                for (int k = 0; k < 26; k++)
                {
                    if (freq[k] > 0 && freq[k] < lowest) lowest = freq[k];
                }
                sum += (highest - lowest);
            }
        }

        return sum;
    }
};
