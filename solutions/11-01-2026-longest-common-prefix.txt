Problem: Longest Common Prefix

Approach:
Used vertical scanning to compare characters column by column.
Treated the first string as a reference.
For each character index, compared the character with the same index in all other strings.
Stopped immediately when a mismatch was found or when any string ended.
The substring up to that index is the longest common prefix.

Time Complexity: O(n × m)
Space Complexity: O(1)

```cpp

class Solution {
public:
    string longestCommonPrefix(vector<string>& strs) {
        
        if (strs.empty()) return "";

        for (int i = 0; i < strs[0].size(); i++)
        {
            char c = strs[0][i];

            for (int j = 1; j < strs.size(); j++)
            {
                if (strs[j][i] != c || i > strs[j].size()) return strs[0].substr(0, i);
            }
        }
        return strs[0];
    }
};
