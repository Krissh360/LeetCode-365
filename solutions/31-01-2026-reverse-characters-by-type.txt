Problem: Reverse Characters by Type

Approach:
The idea is to reverse letters and special characters separately while keeping their original positions.

I traversed the string once and pushed all lowercase letters into one stack and all special characters into another stack. At the same time, I marked the positions in the string using placeholders.

Then, I traversed the string again. Whenever I encountered a placeholder for a letter, I popped from the letters stack. Whenever I encountered a placeholder for a special character, I popped from the special stack.

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(n)


```cpp

class Solution {
public:
    string reverseByType(string s) {

        int n = s.size();
        stack <int> letters;
        stack <int> special;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        {
            if (s[i] >= 97 && s[i] <= 122)
            {
                letters.push(s[i]);
                s[i] = 0;
            }

            else
            {
                special.push(s[i]);
                s[i] = 1;
            }
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        {
            if (s[i] == 0)
            {
                s[i] = letters.top();
                letters.pop();
            }

            else if (s[i] == 1)
            {
                s[i] = special.top();
                special.pop();
            }
        }

        return s;
    }
};
