Problem: Four divisors

Approach: For each number in the array, I counted its divisors by checking values from 1 up to its square root.  
If a number `d` divides 'n', then 'n/d' is also a divisor, so I included both while ensuring I don’t double-count perfect squares.  
While collecting divisors, I also kept a running sum of them.  
After counting, if the number had exactly 4 divisors, I added its divisor sum to the final result.
This solution works correctly, but it runs in 'O(n√m)' in the worst case (where 'm' is the largest number in the input), so it can be optimized further.

Time complexity: O(n√m)
Space complexity: O(1)

```cpp

class Solution {
public:
    int sumFourDivisors(vector<int>& nums) {
        
        int sum = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++)
        {
            int temp_sum = 0;
            int count = 0;

            for (int j = 1; j <= sqrt(nums[i]); j++)
            {   
                if (nums[i] % j == 0)
                {
                    temp_sum += j;
                    count++;

                    if (j != nums[i]/j)
                    {
                        temp_sum += nums[i]/j;
                        count++;
                    }
                }
            }

            if (count == 4) sum += temp_sum;
        }
        return sum;
    }
};
