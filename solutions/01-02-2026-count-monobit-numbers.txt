Problem: Count Monobit Numbers

Approach:
A number is considered a "monobit" if its binary representation consists of continuous 1s from the least significant bit.
Such numbers follow the pattern: 1, 3, 7, 15, 31, and so on

These numbers have a special property:  
For a monobit number `i`, the expression `(i & (i + 1)) == 0` holds true.

So, I iterated from 1 to `n` and checked this bitwise condition.
Every time the condition was satisfied, I increased the count.
I also handled the case when `n == 0` separately.

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)

```cpp

class Solution {
public:
    int countMonobit(int n) {

        if (n == 0) return 1;

        int count = 1;

        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++)
        {
            if ((i & (i+1)) == 0) count ++;
        }

        return count;
         
    }
};
