Problem: Sort characters by frequency

Approach: Since the given string has only English alphabets and digits, I knew that I had to store the frequencies of characters along with the characters in pairs, unlike numbers whose frequencies can be stored in arrays much more easily.
So I decided to use an unordered map to store the character, frequency pairs. But then I realized that I also had to move the characters back to a string with decreasing frequencies. So I moved all the elements of the unordered map to a max heap. Now, I had the characters sorted in the heap in a decreasing order of their frequencies. So, I just copied the character part at the top of heap for every element in a loop, while using the frequency part for the number of times any particular character had to be copied. And kept popping out the top of heap in every iteration.

Time complexity: O(nlogk)
Space complexity: O(n)

```cpp

class Solution {
public:
    string frequencySort(string s) {
        
        unordered_map<char, int> map;
        priority_queue<pair<int, char>> pq;

        for (char x : s)
        {
            map[x]++;
        }

        for (auto &k : map)
        {
            pq.push({k.second, k.first});
        }
        
        string result = "";

        while (!pq.empty())
        {
            pair<int, char> top = pq.top();
            pq.pop();

            int freq = top.first;
            char c = top.second;

            for (int j = 0; j < freq; j++)
            {
                result += c;
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
};
