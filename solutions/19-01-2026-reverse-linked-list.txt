Problem: Reverse Linked List (Recursive)

## Approach
Used a recursive strategy to reverse the linked list.
The idea is to keep moving to the end of the list until reaching the last node.
That last node becomes the new head of the reversed list.

While returning from recursion, each node makes its next node point back to itself.
Then the original next pointer is set to NULL to avoid cycles.
This slowly flips all the links in reverse order.

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(n)

```cpp

class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* reverseList(ListNode* head) {

        if (!head || !head -> next) return head;

        ListNode *temp = reverseList(head -> next);

        head -> next -> next = head;
        head -> next = NULL;

        return temp;
        
    }
};
