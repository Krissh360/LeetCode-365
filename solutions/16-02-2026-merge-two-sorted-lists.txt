Problem: Merge Two Sorted Lists

Approach:
We are given two sorted linked lists and need to merge them into one sorted list.

Instead of creating a new list from scratch, we use recursion to directly rearrange pointers.

Base Cases:
- If list1 is NULL, return list2.
- If list2 is NULL, return list1.

Recursive Idea: Compare the current values of both lists.

If list1->val is greater than list2->val:
- list2 should come first.
- We set list2->next to the result of merging
  list1 with list2->next.
- Return list2.

Otherwise:
- list1 should come first.
- We set list1->next to the result of merging
  list1->next with list2.
- Return list1.

At each step, the smaller node becomes part of the merged list, and recursion handles the rest.

Since each node is visited exactly once, the time complexity is linear.

Time Complexity: O(n + m)
Space Complexity: O(n + m)

```cpp

class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* mergeTwoLists(ListNode* list1, ListNode* list2) {

        if (!list1) return list2;
        if (!list2) return list1;

        if (list1 -> val > list2 -> val)
        {
            list2 -> next = mergeTwoLists(list1, list2 -> next);
            return list2;
        }

        else
        {
            list1 -> next = mergeTwoLists(list1 -> next, list2);
            return list1;
        }
        
    }
};
